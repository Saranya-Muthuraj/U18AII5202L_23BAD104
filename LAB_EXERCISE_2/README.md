# LAB EXERCISE 2

## E-Commerce Transactions Analysis Using R

## Objective

The objective of this lab exercise is to analyze e-commerce transaction data and visualize sales patterns, outliers, and monthly sales intensity using R programming and ggplot2.

---

## Description

This experiment uses e-commerce transaction data to perform exploratory data analysis, including converting transaction dates, extracting time components, and creating visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps to better understand sales trends and detect outliers.

## Files Included

* **analysis_script.R**  
  Contains R code for:  
  * Loading and preprocessing transaction data  
  * Extracting month and year from dates  
  * Plotting histograms and boxplots of transaction amounts  
  * Creating a monthly sales intensity heatmap

* **dataset.csv**  
  The e-commerce transaction dataset

## Visualizations

* **Histogram:** Distribution of transaction amounts  
* **Boxplot:** Detecting outliers in transaction amounts  
* **Heatmap:** Monthly sales intensity aggregated by month and year
