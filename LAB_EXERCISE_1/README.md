# LAB EXERCISE 1

## Student Performance Analysis Using R

## Objective

The objective of this lab exercise is to analyze student performance data and visualize the results using R programming and ggplot2.

---

## Description

In this experiment, a student performance dataset is used to calculate average internal marks and to understand performance patterns across subjects and tests. Data visualization techniques are applied to represent the results clearly.

---

## Files Included

* **code.R**
  Contains R code for:

  * Loading the dataset
  * Data preprocessing
  * Calculating average internal marks
  * Creating visualizations
    
---

## Visualizations

* **Bar Chart:** Displays subject-wise average internal marks
* **Line Chart:** Shows performance trend across internal tests
* **Pie Chart:** Represents final grade distribution

---

## Libraries Used

* ggplot2
* dplyr
* tidyr
* readxl

---

## Conclusion

This lab exercise helped in understanding how R can be used for data analysis and visualization. The use of charts makes it easier to interpret student performance and compare results effectively.
